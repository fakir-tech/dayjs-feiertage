# dayjs-feiertage Project Rules

## Project Overview

This is a dayjs plugin that wraps feiertagejs to provide German holiday functionality for dayjs.

## Code Style

- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Use ESM imports/exports
- Prefer `const` over `let`
- Use explicit return types on exported functions
- Use JSDoc comments for public API methods

## Plugin Development

- All instance methods should be added to `dayjsClass.prototype`
- All static methods should be added to `dayjsFactory`
- Type declarations must be in `declare module "dayjs"` block
- Re-export types that consumers might need

## Testing

- Use Vitest for testing
- Test files should be in `test/` directory with `.test.ts` extension
- Each public method should have at least 3 tests:
  - Happy path
  - Edge case
  - Error/negative case
- Use descriptive test names that explain expected behavior

## Build

- Use tsup for building
- Output both CJS and ESM formats
- Generate declaration files (.d.ts)
- Keep dayjs as external (peer dependency)

## Commits

- Use conventional commit format: `type(scope): message`
- Types: feat, fix, docs, test, refactor, chore
- Keep commits focused and atomic

## Dependencies

- dayjs is a peer dependency (don't bundle it)
- feiertagejs is a runtime dependency
- Keep devDependencies minimal
